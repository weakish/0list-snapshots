If you click on source: rarbg it lists the other versions on rarbg. (served on clearnet)\n\nWould it make sense to add a site-wide preference of file sizes? Not entirely specific but like a quality vs size slider? Love the simplicity of the site though and can understand if you feel it would break the simplicity.",
