You can do this in Firefox by setting up a proxy that does not exist (ie. on a port you have nothing running on) but have localhost excluded.\n\nI'm now visiting zn via a own icecat profile with invalid proxy setting, this also kills http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Ey8WR7e3quTdPTMZZKDdqw2U6JG3zvkHe … seem to work out",
