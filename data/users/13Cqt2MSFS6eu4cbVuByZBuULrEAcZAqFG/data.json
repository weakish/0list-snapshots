				"body": "Very early alpha prototype of a complete decentralized videoportal...\n\nHas 3 parts:\nUser Site (clone this to add your own videos): http://127.0.0.1:43110/1CRFBc4Tn8vvYdNBQCLRbuRwLZkNaHY8kz/\n\nRegister (this is like a torrent site to just add links of valid channels): http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NP1a1aUghi3R6CEtA2WDCzDWE4n9xWmFf/\n\nVideorama Main Site Frontend, with videoplayer , acts like kinox.to frontend to aggregate and play content: http://127.0.0.1:43110/18SZadPsFtTEefBK5CTvRSFiBXs9TvAGEG/\n\nFeel free to clone any part, its made that way for maximum security and free participation or evolution, to avoid portals starting to become \"centralized decentralized\".\nSo anyone can clone the Main Frontend and develop a different looking frontend while pointing to the Registration or another Registration (that is like a hub, but reverse to ZeroMe logic).\n\n\nNote:\nVideos can take 10-15 minutes if over 100MB, depending on speed of peers, etc.\n(If someone knows how to quickstart playing while its still downloading, that would help :)\n\nSeeders/Leechers info would be ace to get help implemented, anyone feel free to clone the master site or userchannel and start experimenting.",
