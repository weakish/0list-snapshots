And here I was thinking that Rss was the simplest way.\n\nor use this it will look neater: <iframe src=\"\" style=\"position:fixed; top:0px; left:0px; bottom:0px; right:0px; width:100%; height:100%; border:none; margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden; z-index:999999;\"></iframe>",

Looks neat and still I am missing the point here - seems to be doing most work at tieps14.herokuapp.com, which would come down to a single point of failure.Does anyone care to explain this site to me?\n> Added it to the roadmap anyways.Available athttp://127.0.0.1:43110/zaphods.bit/RM.html\n\nYeah it was a test site i made in school. I might eventually fully import it to zeronet so its not an iframe anymore but for now its what it is :D",

Zeronet really need more chat services that are more complete, along with forums... Mgh~ x3\n\njust type /help and it gives you the list of commands.\nmain commands needed are: /nick <TheNameYouWant>\n/join <TheNameForTheRoomYouWantToCreate> (Otheres need to type this to join it :D)\n/key <SomeWordOrNumber>(Used to encrypt the chat messages, others need the same key with that command so they can see your messages :D).\n\nand yeas i made it :D",
