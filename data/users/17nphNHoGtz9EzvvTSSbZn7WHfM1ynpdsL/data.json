(this is from a network aspect) That is if I remember correctly on how bitcoin over tor works. (I remember there was a leak because of UDP snitching on tor bitcoin nodes)\n\nFrom a local aspect probably not and this is why you use LUKS on linux. (the latest linux kernel has an over head of <10% if you have a modern Intel/AMD CPU) but *do not* forget to disable swap as well.",
