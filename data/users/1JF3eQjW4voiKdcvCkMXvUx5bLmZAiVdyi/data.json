If the ZeroTorrent admin is indeed MIA I think we should clone ZeroTorrent and start fresh, add more categories, customize the design, etc. Just need to make sure that no one person can fuck things up by disappearing or whatever.",

I know KickAssTorrents had an advanced search functionality, if I were to implement such a thing what should it contain?\n\nThe typical sort-by options: date/time, size, hash, category, uploader, seeds/leechers, popularity.....I think that covers it.",
