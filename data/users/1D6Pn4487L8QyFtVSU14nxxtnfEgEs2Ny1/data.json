Probably should put your own name on it instead of insulting KAT with that mess.\n\nThe name and design is trivial these can be changed but CSS is not one of my strongpoints. If I change it it'll probably just be a name change and some slight tweaks to the color scheme.\n\nRegarding searching I know it's a mess and I can do better than this. When I first announced it [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1_1KCg4tQ1dBRfMWZ8ptrqXSSUKKR11rYb6P/Kick+Ass+Torrent#comment_5_14ng1wByxwoNXAhihYbpgyarVJbFiqs8ny) I said it was alpha / beta quality and it still it.\n\nRight now searching is the least of my concerns but would be grateful if someone else helped contribute here.\n\nA question for you if I may: What sort of search functionality would you like to see? I know KickAssTorrents had an advanced search functionality, if I were to implement such a thing what should it contain?\n\nI pushed out an update yesterday to show a torrents listing page a lot nicer that has a tabbed interface like Kat had with the description, a technical page and for now read-only comments.\n\nNext on my [roadmap](https://gitlab.com/kickasstorrents/KAT/wikis/roadmap) is an upload page so torrents can actually be uploaded and then from there I'm going to revisit categories and searching.",
