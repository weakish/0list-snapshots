If it is OK for people to post publicly to Facebook, then they might as well just post to ZeroNet. As of 2016_09_xx I'm just trying the ZeroNet out for the first time in my life and it seems to me that they have done an awesome job with the GUI. Unfortunately the GUI depends on modern web browsers, which are a beast, written without formal verification. The FBI got around Tor by finding flaws not in the Tor software, but at the FireFox web browser. So, the dependence on such a complex, allthough, I admit, nice looking, GUI, is a security flaw in its own right, at least in 2016, when applications software developers do not use automated search tools for finding abstraction layer specific flaws. (After the C/C++ related memory flaws are found, there's still a lot of other opportunities for flaws.)",
