If someone could provide feedback on what it shows for you, and what happens when you click it that would help.\n\nI also seem to get one of these two errors when writing the files, but it seems to write and store them correctly anyway:\n\n\"Content sign failed: invalid private key.\"\n\n\"Internal error: TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'\nUiWebsocket.py line 98 > UiWebsocket.py line 174 > UiWebsocket.py line 311 > UiWebsocket.py line 277\"",
