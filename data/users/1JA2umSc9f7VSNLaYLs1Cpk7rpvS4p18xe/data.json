Currently we have the largest index anyway, so I should work on compressing it somewhat too.\n\nInteresting! Nonetheless, I was using Bwoi a bit and seemed to be getting some duplicate results, torrent.zerolimits is one example - so the index should probably be cleared, as that might be distracting/annoying to some users.
