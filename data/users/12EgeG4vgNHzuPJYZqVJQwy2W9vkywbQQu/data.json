Further details on the middle of the page where it says \"Our launch date, roadmap and how you can help\".\n\nCurrently it's just an announcement and gaining recognition while we're ripping, verifying, creating torrents, making the listing, etc... in the background. We are uncertain of the launch date but we're aiming for early 2017, or possibly earlier if we're ready earlier. While we're working on that, you can see our progress on that page, as well as what our aim is once we launch.\n\nI'll be updating this listing when we launch!",

The more people seeding the website and downloads when we launch, the better! :)",
